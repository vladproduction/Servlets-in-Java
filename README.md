# Servlets-in-Java
**This repository is a collection of projects by technologies: MVC, JSP, JSF, and JPA;**
##
-servlets:  
	A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities 
	of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. 
	Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend 
	the applications hosted by web servers.

-servlet filter:  
	Servlet Filters are pluggable java components that we can use to intercept and process 
	requests before they are sent to servlets and response after servlet code is finished 
	and before container sends the response back to the client.

-servlet from other servlet:  
	How to call: 
	To include another servlet's output, use the include() method from the RequestDispatcher interface. 
	This method calls a servlet by its URI and waits for it to return before continuing to process 
	the interaction. The include() method can be called multiple times within a given servlet.

-Request dispatcher:  
	A RequestDispatcher is an extremely important JavaSW(Java Web Start starts Java applications) 
	class that allows for 'including' content in a request/response or 'forwarding' a request/response 
	to a resource.As a typical example,a servletW can use a RequestDispatcher to include or 
	forward a request/response to a JSPW.
	  
-MVC (model-view-controller):  
	The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a well-known design pattern in the web development field. 
	It is way to organize our code. It specifies that a program or application shall consist of 
	data model, presentation information and control information.
	
-JSP (java-server-pages or jakarta-server-pages):  
	is a collection of technologies that helps software developers create dynamically generated 
	web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, etc.
	
-JPA (Java-Persistence-API):  
	Jakarta Persistence (JPA; formerly Java Persistence API) is a Jakarta EE application programming 
	interface specification that describes the management of relational data in enterprise Java 
	applications.
	Persistence in this context covers three areas:
	1-The API itself, defined in the jakarta.persistence package (javax.persistence for Jakarta EE 8 and below)
	2-The Jakarta Persistence Query Language (JPQL; formerly Java Persistence Query Language)
	3-Object/relational metadata

-JSF (JavaServer Faces):  
	is a new standard Java framework for building Web applications. It simplifies development by providing a 
	component-centric approach to developing Java Web user interfaces.
	User Interface Components, Renderers, Convertors, Managed Beans, Events and Listeners, Validators, 
	and Page Navigations, are all important components in a JSF.
